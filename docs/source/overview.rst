Overview
========
This program allows simpler creation of the OBS files required for the NANTEN2 telescope through:

* Graphical presentation of the OBS paramaters alongside FITS images
* Interactive mapping specification
* Automated conversion between coordinate systems
* Automated computation for codependent OBS parameters
